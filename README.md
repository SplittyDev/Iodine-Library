# Iodine Programming Language
Iodine is dynamically typed scripting language written in C# to enable rapid prototyping. As of right now, the project is a total work in progress. The syntax of the language is derived from several languages including Python, C#, and PHP. 
### What has been implemented so far?
Currently, Iodine supports the following:
* Lambda Expressions
*  Closures (Through lambda expressions)
*  Duck typing
*  Classes
*  Iterators

I plan on adding more features to the language, and because it is a work in progress no documentation exists at this time. There are however several examples that can be found in the Examples subdirectory of this repository. 

### Future plans with Iodine
Assuming I continue working on this project, I plan on eventually writing an Iodine to C transpiler in Iodine and using this to boot strap a more optimized Iodine interpreter written in Iodine.
